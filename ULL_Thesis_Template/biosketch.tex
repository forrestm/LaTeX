Forrest Montgomery was born in Lafayette, Louisiana for all intents and purposes. He began his academic career at the University of Louisiana with an internal struggle between majoring in Mechanical Engineering or Industrial Design. This thesis is evident of the choice he made. After earning his Bachelor's degree at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in the Spring of 2015, he joined the CRAWLAB and conducted research in dynamics, controls, and robotics under the tutelage of Dr. Joshua Vaughan. This research culminated with earning a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering again at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in the Summer of 2017.
